## Project Overview

Voice Inference Blueprint for Tangle Network. Operators serve TTS inference via vLLM-Omni (Qwen3-TTS), users pay anonymously through ShieldedCredits.

## Architecture

Uses the Tangle Blueprint SDK (`blueprint-sdk` crate) with the canonical lib+bin pattern.

- **contracts/**: Solidity BSM (InferenceBSM) -- validates operator registration (GPU caps), restricts payment to tsUSD, stores model metadata
- **operator/src/lib.rs**: Library crate -- `router()`, `run_tts` job handler (TangleArg/TangleResult), `VoiceInferenceServer` BackgroundService, sol! ABI types
- **operator/src/main.rs**: Binary crate -- BlueprintRunner wiring only (BlueprintEnvironment, TangleProducer, TangleConsumer)
- **operator/src/server.rs**: Axum HTTP server with OpenAI-compatible TTS endpoint (runs as BackgroundService)
- **operator/src/billing.rs**: ShieldedCredits on-chain billing (authorizeSpend/claimPayment) and off-chain EIP-712 SpendAuth signature verification
- **operator/src/voice_engine.rs**: vLLM-Omni subprocess management (spawn, health check, speech synthesis proxy)
- **operator/src/config.rs**: Operator config structs (VoiceModelConfig, billing, GPU, server)
- **operator/src/health.rs**: GPU detection via nvidia-smi
- **sdk/**: TypeScript client -- signs SpendAuth, discovers operators, sends TTS requests

## Build Commands

### Contracts
```bash
cd contracts && forge build && forge test
```

### Operator
```bash
cargo build -p voice-inference
```

### SDK
```bash
cd sdk && npm install && npm run build
```

## SDK Patterns

This project follows the Tangle Blueprint SDK patterns:

- **Router**: `Router::new().route(JOB_ID, handler.layer(TangleLayer))`
- **Job handlers**: `async fn handler(TangleArg(req): TangleArg<SolType>) -> TangleResult<SolType>`
- **ABI types**: Defined via `alloy_sol_types::sol!` macro
- **Background services**: `impl BackgroundService for VoiceInferenceServer`
- **Runner**: `BlueprintRunner::builder(TangleConfig::default(), env).router(...).producer(...).consumer(...).run().await`

## Key Dependencies

```toml
blueprint-sdk = { version = "0.1.0-alpha.22", features = ["std", "tangle", "macros"] }
```

## Billing Flow

1. User funds ShieldedCredits account (one ZK proof)
2. User signs EIP-712 SpendAuth per request (off-chain, cheap)
3. Operator verifies SpendAuth signature off-chain (ecrecover)
4. Operator serves TTS synthesis
5. Operator calls `authorizeSpend` on-chain (reserves payment)
6. Operator calls `claimPayment` (receives tokens)

Billing is per-character: `cost = (characters * price_per_1k_characters) / 1000`

## Testing

- Contracts: `forge test` in contracts/
- Operator: `cargo test` at workspace root
- SDK: `npm test` in sdk/

## Testing Standards

**Priority order (highest to lowest):**
1. **Full lifecycle tests** using `SeededTangleTestnet` — anvil + Tangle Core contracts + `BlueprintRunner` + `TangleProducer/Consumer`. Job submitted on-chain → operator processes → result submitted on-chain. This is the only test that proves the system works.
2. **Real server integration tests** — start the actual axum server, mock only the external backend (the GPU process we cannot run without hardware), send real HTTP requests, verify real responses.
3. **Real contract tests** — `forge test` with actual Solidity logic: registration validation, pricing, payment splitting, access control.
4. **Real algorithm tests** — test actual math/logic (DeMo optimizer, layer range calculation, checkpoint hashing). Only where the logic is non-trivial.

**What is NOT acceptable:**
- Serialization roundtrip tests (these prove nothing)
- Mocking our own code (mock the external dependency, not our server)
- Tests that pass with empty/hardcoded responses
- "Coming soon" or stub tests that test nothing
- Unit tests of getters/setters

**Testing tools:**
- `SeededTangleTestnet` / `MultiHarness` from `blueprint-anvil-testing-utils` for full lifecycle
- `wiremock` for mocking external backends (vLLM, diffusion, embedding servers)
- `forge test` with real contract deployment for Solidity
- `anvil` for local EVM testing
- Real `blueprint-manager` binary for operator lifecycle

**Every PR must include:**
- A test that exercises the actual user flow end-to-end
- No decrease in test coverage of critical paths
- Contract tests for any new on-chain logic


## Blueprint SDK Testing Tools (use these)

The Blueprint SDK provides real testing infrastructure at `blueprint-anvil-testing-utils`:

```rust
// Full lifecycle test — the gold standard
use blueprint_anvil_testing_utils::{MultiHarness, OperatorFleet, OperatorSpec};

let harness = MultiHarness::builder()
    .add_blueprint("my-blueprint", my_router(), service_id)
    .spawn()
    .await?;

let handle = harness.handle("my-blueprint").unwrap();

// Submit a real on-chain job
let submission = handle.submit_job(JOB_INDEX, payload).await?;

// Wait for operator to process and return result on-chain
let result = handle.wait_for_job_result(submission).await?;

// Decode and verify
let decoded: MyResultType = MyResultType::abi_decode(&result)?;
assert_eq!(decoded.status, "success");
```

**Available tools:**
- `SeededTangleTestnet` — boots anvil with all Tangle Core contracts
- `MultiHarness` — multi-blueprint test harness with operator fleets
- `BlueprintHandle` — submit jobs, wait for results, check status
- `TestRunner` — lightweight single-blueprint runner
- `OperatorFleet` — configure honest/malicious operators for Byzantine testing
- `TangleHarness` — lower-level harness with direct contract access

**Dev dependencies to add:**
```toml
[dev-dependencies]
blueprint-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/tangle-network/blueprint", branch = "main", features = ["testing", "tangle"] }
blueprint-anvil-testing-utils = { git = "https://github.com/tangle-network/blueprint", branch = "main" }
wiremock = "0.6"
tempfile = "3"
```
